The gale-shapley algorithm is an n^2 if implemented in the most efficent way.
Dispite our best efforts, the algorithm runs with a complexity of n^3.
We recored our time with the linux time command. The average runtime of 
our program with an input of 10 was .020 seconds. With an input of 100
the average runtime was .026 seconds. With an input size of 1000 the
average runtime was .336 seconds, and 14.357 seconds with an input size
of 500.
